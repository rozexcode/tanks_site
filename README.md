# tanks_site

This is my first bigger HTML/CSS project I did for school back in 2020. 

It was also my first attempt to add RWD and more advanced concepts such as grid. 
(The assignment I was supposed to do was a simple HTML/CSS structure with ancient styling methods such as float: left and stuff,
but I wanted to take a bigger dive into the WEB DEV world, and thus it was my first more real life experience of what this this actually is)

I upload this to github 3 years later simply from nostalgic reasons, and because now I am actually learning how to use GIT,
so please don't treat it like a real portfolio-like kind of project
